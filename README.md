# Exploring-Splitting-Techniques-Impact-on-Model-Accuracy

Introduction:
In the realm of machine learning, the choice of splitting technique profoundly influences model performance. In this blog post, we delve into the effects of two common splitting techniques, k-fold cross-validation and random split, on the accuracy of predictive models.

Experiment Design:
We conducted experiments on a diverse dataset, employing various machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. For each algorithm, we compared the performance of models trained using k-fold cross-validation and random split techniques.

Key Findings:
1) Decision Trees: K-fold cross-validation yielded more stable performance compared to random split, especially on small datasets.
2) Random Forests: Demonstrated robustness to splitting techniques, with consistent performance across both methods.
3) Support Vector Machines: Showed improved generalization with k-fold cross-validation, resulting in higher accuracy.

Conclusion:
The choice of splitting technique plays a vital role in model training and evaluation. While k-fold cross-validation offers a comprehensive assessment of model performance, random split remains practical for large datasets. Understanding the impact of splitting techniques empowers practitioners to make informed decisions in model development and deployment.
